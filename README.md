## A. Background 
To increase the flow of money in this bank, the digital marketer team want to know what customer segment that have the highest balance percentage. This process is important to know what kind of services that suits best for this kind of customer. In this model I'm using [K-Means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) Clustering as the main algorithm. 

**Requirements : numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, yellowbrick**
  
## B. Overview 
In this model I'm using three-level clustering. First clustering was separate the balane's outliers and non outliers, this analysis was helped with boxplot diagram.
